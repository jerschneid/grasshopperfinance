To do:

 XCommit everything to source
 XFinish no cowboy coding thing

 - Include real data
 - Pick random start/end times for 10 year period
 - Implement buy/sell buttons, track actual growth
 - Fix axis to show % growth and time frame
 - Implement dividends
 - Implement end game... player score vs riding the market
 - Make site look less ugly


Non-MVP
 - Include start/stop buttons
 - Include faster/slower buttons
 - Server saving of scores

 - Do a git deploy (might involve paying hosting more money)
 - Document deploy process and database syncing
 - Make some sort of coherent home page?!


Notes:
 - Yahoo Finance let's us download historical data, including dividends... But the prices and dividends come separately. Getting it into a single table might be rough (do we need to?)
