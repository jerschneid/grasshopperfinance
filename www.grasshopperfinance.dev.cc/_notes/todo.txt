To do:

 XCommit everything to source
 XFinish no cowboy coding thing

XInclude real data
XPick random start/end times for 10 year period - Create "Start state" with instructions and start button to start the click
XImplement buy/sell buttons, track actual growth
X"Play again/Finish/Ride it out/Done" button runs out the clock (as fast as possible... calculate the whole chart before drawing?)

 - Install better theme: https://wordpress.org/themes/devdmbootstrap4/
   - Look into bootstrap.build
   - Document how to switch themes	

 - Create end state showing
   - Your growth of $10,000 vs buy and hold
   - Number of trades
   - Percent growth
   - Time period involved
 - Create scoreboard below chart
  - Your net worth
  - Buy and hold
  - Number of trades
  - % growth
 - Fix axis to show % growth and time frame
 - Fix all the "reset" stuff
 - Make site look less ugly
 - Possible to be mobile friendly (chart seems to have a ton of deadspace around the edges... maybe CSS for screen width to remove it?)
 - Server saving of scores
 - Test on shitty hardware (chromebook?! old windows machine, different browser)
 - Look at size of vfinx.js and reduce whitespace and decimals
 - BUG: Clicking start too soon breaks stuff

Non-MVP
 - Include start/stop buttons
 - Include faster/slower buttons
 - High scores list
   - Best score ever
   - Best score of the day
   - Average 
   - Average by number of trades
   - Trends by number of trades


 - Do a git deploy (might involve paying hosting more money)
 - Document deploy process and database syncing
 - Make some sort of coherent home page?!
 - Automate collection of VFINX data?


Notes:
 - Yahoo Finance let's us download historical data, including dividends... But the prices and dividends come separately. Getting it into a single table might be rough (do we need to?)
 - The adjusted price does include dividends reinvested.
