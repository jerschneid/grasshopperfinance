To do:

 XCommit everything to source
 XFinish no cowboy coding thing

XInclude real data
XPick random start/end times for 10 year period - Create "Start state" with instructions and start button to start the click
XImplement buy/sell buttons, track actual growth
X"Play again/Finish/Ride it out/Done" button runs out the clock (as fast as possible... calculate the whole chart before drawing?)
XInstall better theme: https://wordpress.org/themes/devdmbootstrap4/
XDocument how to switch themes	
 XCreate scoreboard below chart
  XYour net worth
  XBuy and hold
XFix axis to show % growth and time frame

XTime period involved
XNumber of trades
XNumber of trades
XWire up reset buttons (hide uneccessary buttons)
XCreate end state showing
XPercent growth
Xfavicon
XDo a git deploy (might involve paying hosting more money)
XDocument deploy process and database syncing
XTest on shitty hardware (chromebook?! old windows machine, different browser)
XUse Phinx to set up database migrations
XAdd indexes to columns?
XAdd REST API: https://v2.wp-api.org/extending/adding/
XRead article above to better understand why they do things?
XServer saving of scores
XCall Rest API, have it enter complete data
XSet up scoreboard with simple results
XFormat record board (move it outside of game)
XInstall Google analytics
XMake mobile friendly (CSS media queries)
XFix funky scrolling when you hit start
XClean up faster/slower buttons
XLook at size of vfinx.js and reduce whitespace and decimals
XMake sure all the records with the domain are correct (non www version?)
XBUG: Clicking start too soon breaks stuff


 - Remove all javascript console logging (way to minify and do this automatically or something?)

Non-MVP
 - Headlines of the day (wall street journal, your uncle, CNN money, Jim Kramer, Bloomberg?!)
 - High scores list
   - Best score ever
   - Best score of the day
   - Trends by number of trades

Site stuff
 - Make some sort of coherent home page
 - Time the market game in top menu?
 - Make a "category" page for just texts?
 - Look into bootstrap.build


Next Projects:
 - Build a "beat the index" game (Pick 10 oldest stocks in the Dow Jones... checkboxes next to each, random 10 year period)
 - Build the "investment growth calculator"
   - Choose rate of return (before/after inflation)
   - Choose "last X years of S&P 500"
   - Choose "Random period of S&P 500"
 - Lottery simulator (one per named game?)

Notes:
 - Yahoo Finance let's us download historical data, including dividends... But the prices and dividends come separately. Getting it into a single table might be rough (do we need to?)
 - The adjusted price does include dividends reinvested.
