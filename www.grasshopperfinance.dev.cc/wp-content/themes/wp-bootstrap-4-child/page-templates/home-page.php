            <p>The world of money and investing is confusing. Almost everybody in the industry has an incentive to make money at your expense. Personal Finance Club teaches how to handle money and invest without any misaligned incentives.</p>
            <p>Below you'll find the habits, steps, and rules to become a multi-millionaire. This is the simple, 
                tried-and-true method to live below your means, invest well and become wealthy over time.
            </p>
            <h4>The Habits</h4>
            <p>
                These three life long habits are the bedrock on which you can build and stay wealthy.
            </p>

                      1. Know the “why”
                </div>

                  <div class="card-body">
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Maximize Happiness:</strong> The goal of building wealth should be to maximize your happiness across your life, not to die with the most zeroes in your bank account.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Seek Contentment:</strong> Realize that there will always be someone with more stuff, bigger stuff, better stuff. No person can ever be rich until he decides he has more than he wants.
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Spending Is Not Wealth:</strong> When you see someone driving a new BMW, 
                            living in a fancy house, buying rounds at the club or wearing the fanciest clothes, more often than
                            not that person is broke, living paycheck to paycheck and up to their eyeballs in debt. Most millionaires are driving used cars, living modestly and putting their money to work to build wealth rather than burning it on overpriced stuff today.
                        <li><strong>Happier With A Plan:</strong> For those of you who want to YOLO and live for today. You will be HAPPIER today if you have a plan and know you are set up for later. It will mean not going into debt up to your eyeballs and spending every penny that comes into your hand, but your happiness will increase both later in life when you're not working at a diner and eating catfood as well as today when you have more peace and security.
                        </li>   
                    </ul>

                      2. Live below your means

                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>You can't fill a leaking bucket:</strong> If you spend every dollar you earn you will always be broke. The math is simple. One minus one equals zero. Living below your means is an absolute requirement to build wealth.</li>
                            <li><strong>$1 saved is $1.XX earned:</strong> Spending less is a <i>more powerful</i> wealth building tool than earning more money. Your income is taxed. So if you want to spend a dollar you have to EARN $1.XX where the XX is your total income tax rate. Federal income tax, social security tax, medicare tax, state income taxes, etc. That all comes out of your earnings. What you have LEFT you can spend. If you DON'T SPEND a dollar you already have you get to KEEP (or invest and grow!) that entire dollar. 
                            </li>

                            <li><strong>Not a silver bullet:</strong> This is the least important of the three habits. Having a high income and high spending does not equal wealth. (See habits one and two!). But it's undeniable that for some low income earners there is no option but to increase earnings in order to make more than the bare necessities cost. For everyone, earning more (and not spend it) will accelerate your path to great wealth!</li>
                            <li><strong>You can't outearn bad spending habits:</strong> If you haven't committed to habits one and two, this one won't save you. Many people make six figures and beyond and still live paycheck to paycheck.</li>
                            <li><strong>You can't squeeze water from a rock:</strong> If you are a very low income earner, there's only so much you can squeeze from your income. 
                            </li>
                        </ul>
